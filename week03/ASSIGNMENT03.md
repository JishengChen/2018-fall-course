## Brief

This week we will use the data we collected about our mobility behavior in our [week 2 assignment](../week02/ASSIGNMENT02.md) to tell the story of how we traveled last week. Rather than creating hand drawn visualizations, we will be using more computational methods to highlight different aspects of our travel behavior throughout the city.

Our goal in this exercise is to use a real-world example of data that is deeply personal to us, unpack it, and present the results in a way that might allow us to reflect on what the data say about us.

The following questions should be answered by this exercise

* distance traveled:
  * what was your total distance traveled last week?
  * which day did your travel the most last week?
  * on which transport did you travel the most?
* trip duration
  * what was your total time spent traveling last week?
  * which day did you spend the most time traveling?
  * how long did you spend on the different transport modes?
* "simple" CO2 emissions calculation
  * based on your distance traveled using transport mode X,Y, or Z, what is your co2 emissions impact?

Challenge: Can you communicate the uncertainty of your CO2 emissions calculations visually?
Hint: how about error bars?

These additional questions might also be derived from your analysis:

* Timing
  * At what times do you tend to travel? Is your travel behavior relatively regular or is it more variable?
* Places
  * what are your most common trips?
  * what are some outliers?
* Other pollutants associated with your travel choices?


## Deliverables

The result of this exercise will be a markdown file (.md) blog post (or via your respective blogs) that explains your mobility behavior. You will use images and text to highlight the key variables listed in the brief as well as any other points of interest.
