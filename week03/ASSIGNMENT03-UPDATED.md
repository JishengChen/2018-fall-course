# ASSIGNMENT 03 (updated): Introduction to Computational Media
**DUE:** 27 September 2018, 6:00 PM


## Brief

NOTE: As part of a bit of course restructuring, we are going to focus the next couple weeks on establishing a base level of computational literacy. As part of this effort, you will be assigned a "playlist" of videos to watch before coming to class so we can work together in class to discuss our learnings and questions and make amazing things together.

### P5.js Introduction

P5.js is a library written in javascript that makes creating interactive and visual things (like data visuals!) possible in the web browser. P5.js was inspired by the programming environment Processing which aimed to make coding and computation more accessible to artists, designers (hey that's us!), and people not traditionally represented in the computational world. The idea was to allow artists and designers to build their own tools.

This week your task is to do 2 things:

1. Write a short paragraph about your master's research interests and write out how you might apply computation to furthering your research goals. If you have come across any datasets that are of interest, please note them down. If you might be interested to collect data, write down what you would be interested to collect and why. Note down also why you are particularly interested or not interested in coding.

2. Watch the following videos and follow along with Dan Shiffman as he takes you through introducing p5.js, setting up an account on the p5.js web editor, and introducing you to your very first experiences with programming. Total: `~1hr 30 min` (sorry no netflix tonight!)

* [Code! Programming for Beginners with p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWkPOfnGsw) | 13 min
* [Introduction to the p5 web editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXs1cOlidWs) | 8 min
* [Shapes & Drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3TeLi6Ns1E) | 25 min
* [Errors & Console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuGsp5KeJMM) | 6 min
* [Code Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJcrPJuem5Q) | 4 min
* [Variables in P5.js (mouseX, mouseY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnS0YNuLfQQ) | 12 min
* [Variables in p5.js (Make your own) - p5.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn_B3T_Vbxs) | 12 min

If you find yourself needing some more inspiration, here's a few talks and examples that I've always found to motivate my learning:

* Lauren McCarthy, OpenVis Conf, [LEARNING WHILE MAKING P5 JS Lauren McCarthy](https://youtu.be/1k3X4DLDHdc?t=16m16s)
* Casey Reas, [How To Draw With Code | Casey Reas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8DMEHxOLQE)
* [The gap by Ira Glass](https://vimeo.com/85040589)
* [Will Geary | 24 hours of buses in NYC](http://gothamist.com/2017/04/05/soothing_taxi_video.php)
* [City Flows](https://vimeo.com/173760057)




## Deliverables

1. Short blog post on "How does computation and data visualization relate to your research interests?"
2. Bring your questions and be ready on Thursday to make some p5.js sketches in class on Thursday.
