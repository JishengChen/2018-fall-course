## ASSIGNMENT

* [Link to Assignment 3](ASSIGNMENT03.md)

This week we will use the data we collected about our mobility behavior in our [week 2 assignment](../week02/ASSIGNMENT02.md) to tell the story of how we traveled last week. For more, go to the assignment brief above.

## AGENDA

<!--

- have a look at different data structures
- restructuring data
- csv, json, geographic data, timeseries, time

-->

**Project Highlight - Critique & Feedback**

**DISCUSSION:**

* Make groups of 4-5, present eachother your Dear Data Assignment, shareouts as group
* Project Highlight: https://carto.com/blog/looking-at-the-l/
* Github:
  * grabbing latest from a fork
  * review - how many people went through the exercises?
  * questions & debugging
* Data Processing Exercise using collected Data
  * Collect data generated via google forms
  * calculate distances traveled
  * calculate trip duration
  * apply "simple" co2 emissions calculation based on mode of transport and distance
  * plot results in a way that tells the story.
  * share as markdown file.

<!--
* Data Compositions:
  * A look into common data structures and how to work with them
  * Specific emphasis on common formats:
    * csv
    * json
    * geographic data:
      * .shp
      * geojson
      * geotiffs and raster data?
  * How to handle specific properties:
    * time & timeseries
