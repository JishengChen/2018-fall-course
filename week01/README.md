# WEEK `01`
## Visual Encoding

## ASSIGNMENT

* [Link to ASSIGNMENT 1](ASSIGNMENT01.md)

Along with getting set up with the logistics and tools for this course, this week you will be writing a short (2-3 paragraphs) critique on a visualization that resonates with you. See the assignment briefing for details.

* Beginning of the [Daily Charting Challenge](../daily-sketch-challenge.md)

I would like nothing more than for you all to walk out of this class as total data viz ninjas, but the only way to get there is with practice and a portfolio of work. I would like to propose "thinking through making" with an (optional) Daily Charting Challenge. Go to the link for details.
