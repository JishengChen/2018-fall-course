## On Tools

* Lisa Rost, ["1 Chart, 12 Tools"](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-tools/), May 2016
  - In this post, Lisa goes through 12 data viz tools (the post below is a follow up) and her experiences making the same chart in each. Some of the tools are probably things you'd never use, and now there are a bunch more, but it is good overview of different charting tools and the defaults which make visualization easier in some cases and more difficult in others.
* Lisa Rost, ["1 Chart, 12 Charting Libraries"](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/)., May 2016
  - Lisa goes through a number of (12) data viz charting environments to give a personal take on the chart making experience in each. There are a lot more charting environments and frameworks these days, but her systematic approach gives you an idea of the similarities and differences, advantages and disadvantages.
