you can even do really cool code highlighting like this:

```
look at me
i'm some code
```

but even cooler is if you set what type of code it is:

```js

var hello = "hello"

function greetings(input ){
  return input
}
```

see all those nice colors?


We can do other languages as well:

```python

myData = [1,2,3,4]
```


inline code is also a thing, you can write `hi there stranger` and you'll get that grey background. Pretty cool eh?
