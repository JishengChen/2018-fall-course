Hello dear student!

If you're watching this, you're probably wanting to make a Github Gist.

What are we waiting for? let's do it!

(Scratch that)

# Step 1: go to the "plus button âž•" in the top right corner next to your profile image and click "new gist"

(You will now be taken to a new page that will allow you to make a new gist)

you can enter a gist description ðŸ‘‰

enter a filename + extension ðŸ‘‰
how about `test.md`

add your markdown text here (markdown since it is a .md file)

now click "create public gist"



## Wow! see how you just created a markdown file that is now rendered by Github? It also creates a URL for this gist that you can share with the world.

Now, what if you want to edit your gist?

Check out the edit button in the top-right  ðŸ‘‰

Don't forget to click "update public gist"



I even just make a comment here ðŸ‘‰


Now if you want you can add more stuff to your gist. Let's try to add a file.





ðŸ‘‰ see you can add a file right here:





Whoops! you can see the file has some red showing because I didn't include a closing quotation mark. let's fix that.

Yay! all gone!


Right. so that's all about you need to know for now. Happy gist making!

ciao!
