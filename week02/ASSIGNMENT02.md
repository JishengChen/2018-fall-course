## Brief

This week we will begin dipping our toes into the data visualization workflow. This will involve:
  - defining a question(s)
  - determining variables that speak to the research question
  - selecting and defining a method for tracking, collecting, and/or acquiring the data we need
  - data collection
  - filtering, grouping, and processing your data to make sense of it
  - analyzing your data to pull out key insights and information worth communicating
  - experimenting with representation
  - defining the visual form which best speaks to the data/information you're interested in communicating
  - creating the visual for all the see
  - documenting your work to explain your visual
  - "defending" / explaining your process and visualization to your peers.

**Are you ready!? So exciting! Let's go!**

* a week of emails *

With the above process in mind, we will be following in the methodologies of the great [Stephanie Posavek](http://www.stefanieposavec.com/) and [Georgia Lupi](http://giorgialupi.com/) and building our own "Dear Data" hand drawn data visualizations. By this time next week, we will have 25 super curious and procedurely hand-generated visualizations of 1 week of our [mobility behavior]() - when and by which transporation mode - do we take to get from A to B.

We will define the process below:

### Collect

Here's a video showing how you can:
1. create google form
2. add the relevant questions regarding our mobility behavior
3. add the form to the homescreen of your phone for easier access
4. look at your data in google spreadsheets
5. export that spreadsheet to a csv file.

**Follow along here**: https://youtu.be/BOn7t_7csYE

**Form questions**

Create a google form. In this google form you will create 2 sections. `Section 1: Primary Data` will include the data directly about your trip. `Section 2: Supplementary Data` will include the data that we will derive later on during our extended analysis.

* Section 1:
  - question: Transport_Mode (multiple choice)
    - Bike
    - Bus
    - Train/Subway
    - Walking
    - On Demand Automobile Service (e.g. taxi, Lyft, Uber, Via, Car2Go, etc)
    - Private Automobile
    - Ferry/Boat
    - Plane
  - question: Starting_From (short answer)
    - e.g. "home"
  - question: Ending_At (short answer)
    - e.g. "SVA"
  - question: Date (data)
    - e.g. `MM/DD/YYYY`
  - question: Trip_Start (time)
    - e.g. `HH:MM AM/PM`
  - question: Trip_End (time)
    - e.g. `HH:MM AM/PM`
  - question: Notes (paragraph)
    - e.g. `going to work`
* Section 2: (these we will fill-in later on)
  - Latitude_Start (short answer)
    - e.g. `40.742417`
    - units: decimal degrees
  - Longitude_Start (short answer)
    - e.g. `-73.995713`
    - units: decimal degrees
  - Latitude_End (short answer)
    - e.g. `40.742417`
    - units: decimal degrees
  - Longitude_End (short answer)
    - e.g. `-73.995713`
    - units: decimal degrees
  - Distance_Traveled (short answer)
    - e.g. `12.6`
    - units: miles
  - Additional Notes (short answer)
    - e.g. `some supplementary notes`
  - Trip_Duration (short answer)
    - e.g. `106`
    - units: minutes

<!-- * tracking using Nomie2 App
* create 8 trackers:
  - Bike
  - Bus
  - Train
  - Plane
  - Foot
  - On Demand Service
  - Private vehicle
  - Other
* Tap the tracker at the **beginning** of each trip
* Each time a tap occurs (see example export below):
  - the location is stored
  - the timestamp is stored
  - the count is stored

NOTE: Take notes about where you might have gone each day
-->


### Parse

<!--
* at the end of each day, export the data to **.csv**
* at the end of the week, compile all those data together.
* Copy and paste all the data into a Google Spreadsheet, Numbers, or Excel
* Sort by `excel_date` to see your data in order by date/time
-->



NOTE: Take notes about any problems you encounter in this step and how you've overcome them

### Filter and Mine

* From here, it is up to you to decide what features you'd like to highlight, filter, and group. By looking around your data, you might also start to find out certain insights that are unique to you and your knowledge of your behaviors. Note those down - do your data indicate you have a pretty regular transport behaviors? or do you mix it up this week? You should be able to start identifying some trends or a lackthereof.

NOTE: Take notes about the methods you are employing onto your data.

### Represent & Interact

* With your notes in hand, begin playing with various visual forms - is it necessary to draw a map or is a bar chart ok? Do you go for something more expressive or literal?
* Sketch out a few different visual expressions of your data to refine your understanding of what your data might be saying.
* You may consider moodboarding based on what kinds of things you've found in your data.

NOTE: Take notes and photos of your sketches and visual experiments. Don't get caught up with perfection here, while you are perfect, your sketches do not need to be ;) !

### Refine
* You've sketched out a number of options, what has emerged? Is the aggregate of the week more interesting or do your day-to-days reveal something special?
* Define the rules for your visualization - how are your data visually encoded by parameters such as length, area, direction, hue, saturation, etc?
* Finally, draw your data illustration using your defined rules on your postcard!
* Remember to include a legend on how to read your illustration.
* If you wish to include an address, please put the SVA DSI address:

```
SVA DSI
136 W 21st St,
5th Fl.
New York, NY 10011
```

NOTE: Document your final outcome with photos.
