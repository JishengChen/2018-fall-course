# Daily Sketch Challenge

There's a really great creative practice called "[the 100 day project](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days)" in which you do a creative activity, whatever you want, every day for 100 days.

I know you've all got a million things going on, but I am going to also try to participate in a daily chart making exercise as part of this course. My hope is that by making a chart every day, it will give us the opportunity to quickly learn these new skills presented in this course.

The goal is the just open up R or D3 or whatever charting environment is exciting to you, and make 1 new thing a day. It doesn't have to be amazing, it just has to be new or different from your other previous sketches. Building off of a previous dataset or visualization is all fair game.

NOTE: This is not mandatory, but I think it will be a fun way to keep the pressure low and the fun high. Presumably everyone will have similar charts in the beginning, but we will start to see a divergence as we get comfortable with data visualization and the various tools and methods we pick up over the course of the semester.

## Posting Daily

* post an image and your code (if/when possible) as a gist every day
* A short blurb about the chart and potential ideas that came out of the chart or ideas for further exploration can be helpful.


## Some ideas for data:

* NYC weather (or the weather of your hometown)
* Climate Datasets
* 311 phone calls
* Personal habits (e.g. how many coffees you have a day, or emails recieved vs emails sent)
* (you can also make up random data if you just want practice creatively charting)
