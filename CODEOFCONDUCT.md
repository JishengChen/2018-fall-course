# Code of Conduct

It's not that hard, code or respect. You will be expected to produce both in this class.

This code of conduct is a partnership we are building in mutual respect. I take it personally when you miss my classes and my assignments; being ontime is a way to show myself and the other students that you have respect for us. If you fail to do that, you're hindering your own education, but more importantly you're hindering your reputation as a person with integrity.

Here are a few general things:

* Late assignments will not be accepted
* Attendance is mandatory barring an emergency which you can work out with the instructor over email.
* Regardless of circumstances, you're expected to turn in your assignment on the day that it's due, and otherwise keep up with work.
