## Course Description

Mapping data to visuals is as much an exercise in design as it is a political one. The ways in which we filter, aggregate, scale, and process data into information are an accumulation of decisions guided consciously and unconciously by our training and our biases (and perhaps even ignorances) that ultimately affect people and places from local to global scales. Now more than ever, we carry immense power and responsibility to critically engage with the tools, the people, the institutions, and the discourses surrounding data driven and generative visualizations.

This course is about data visualization and the technologies that allow for information production and propogation. By working through the data visualization pipeline, from data aquisition to designing interactions, we will develop an understanding of how to build beautiful and thoughtful visual outputs using the modern web.

This course is project based, comprised of several visualizaion projects and culminating in a final project. The goal is to allow you to expand and extend your skills towards your own topic of interest and/or coursework.

## Learning Objectives & Outcomes

The goal of this course is to establish the technical and conceptual foundations for building thoughtful, engaging, and considerate information visualizations. By engaging with each step of the data visualization process, from data acquisition to interface design, you will learn to critically engage with data and the tools and media for communicating through/with data on the web.

Core outcomes of this course include your ability to:

* assess, manipulate, and analyze data
* critically engage with the politics of data and information visualization
* create visualizations and other tangible media from data of varying formats and sources using HTML5 (html/css/javascript)
* effectively use version control and collaboration workflows (e.g. Github)
* publish visualizations to the web

## Grading

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final project. It is understood that coding is tough and you may be new to this, you will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peer reviewers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

GRADE CALCULATION: Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:

* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 40% Assignments
* 10% Project Proposal
* 40% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%
