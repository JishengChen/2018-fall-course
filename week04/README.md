## AGENDA

**DISCUSSION:**

* Quick motivational speech: [The gap by Ira Glass](https://vimeo.com/85040589)
* Re-Roadmapping for the course:
  * Weeks 4 - :
  * Weeks
* Insight from assignments: people really grasped the data viz process - cool to see people framing their blog posts around that.
* We live in a computational and data driven world
  * [James Bridle, ]()
* Data visualizations provide opportunites to see, for example:
  * Trevor Paglen, [Surveying Surveillance](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/secret-state-trevor-paglen-documents-the-hidden-world-of-governmental-surveillance-from-drone-bases-9536376.html) | Photography
  * Josh Begley, [Prison Map](http://prisonmap.com/) | Photography, Mapping
  * Gelare Koshgozaran, [Why | 2010](https://gelarekhoshgozaran.com/VISUAL/WHY-2010) | Video, screen recording
  * Periscopic, [US Gun Deaths](https://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013) | Animation, interactive web
  * Propublica, [Losing Ground](https://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/) | Interactive web
  * Pudding.cool, [The road to gender parity in the House of Representatives](https://pudding.cool/2018/07/women-in-congress/)
  * Amy Cesal, Day Doh Viz [Daily visualizations with play doh](https://www.amycesal.com/day-doh-viz-all/)
  * Nicholas Felton, [2014 Annual Feltron Report](http://feltron.com/FAR14.html)
  * Hint.fm, [Wind Map](http://hint.fm/wind/)
  * Jenny O'Dell, [All the People on Google Earth](http://www.jennyodell.com/allthepeople.html)
  *
* Why computation and why P5.js?
  *
  * It's a great learning tool. Sure some of the more complex visualizations are trickier and it isn't as great for some things as others, but
  * Great community and lots of examples
  * Opens up

**Project Highlight - Critique & Feedback**
* []
*

**STUDIO:**

Let's review what we've learned through the assigned videos:

* In the [Week 3 Assignment (Updated)](../week03/ASSIGNMENT03-UPDATED.md) we learned about:
  * **P5.js**, it's origins, and why it is interesting for us as artist, designers, and makers of things
  * **The P5 web editor** - an online code editor that allows us to write and interact with our programs in the browser
  * **Shapes and Drawing** with P5.js and the very basic syntax for adding shapes and visuals to a drawing canvas as well as how to read documentation on how to discover new shapes.
  * **Color** in P5.js and how to change the stroke and fill of our different canvas elements like our rectangles, circles, and lines
  * **Errors** and how to read, understand, and debug programs if your computer doesn't understand your commands.
  * **Code comments** and how to make sure we can write out clear notes about how things work in our programs.
  * The **setup()** and **draw()** functions and how the p5.js structure allows us to create animations
  * **Variables** like `mouseX` and `mouseY` and also self-defined variables that allow us to better control our programs
* This means we should at this point we can effectively:
  * use code to draw shapes to the screen, change the colors of those shapes, and begin to **parameterize** our sketches using variables.


<!--

- Week 4: **introduction to computation**
  - how are data and computation related?
  - why should we care about computation?
  - how are data being visualized?
  - intro to p5 and coding visuals
  - **Studio**:
    - Downloading p5 projects from p5 editor and working locally
    - review of variables and parameterization
      - variable scope: global and function level
    - introducing your own custom functions:
      - functions that do stuff
      - functions that return data
  - **Assignment**:
    - Coded Composition I
    - Watch videos: objects, map(), random() conditionals, iteration


-->

## PRACTICE


> imitation is the sincerest form of flattery

Today we will reinforce what we've learned so far and extend our skills by coding one of the following drawings of your choice and remixing it by parameterizing aspects of the forms with variables and user interactions. See [ASSIGNMENT04.md](ASSIGNMENT04.md) for details.

* This is a workshop I made for the Processing environment. Almost everything should work EXCEPT the sections on "Data" will be different and instead of `void setup() and void draw()` we have `function setup() and function draw()` among other differences: https://github.com/joeyklee/aloha-processing
